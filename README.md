This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, including class design, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
It consists of two assignments that bring these principles to life:

Smartphone Class with Inheritance: Models a basic smartphone and a more advanced version with camera functionality.
Polymorphic Vehicle Classes: Demonstrates polymorphism by creating different types of vehicles, each with a unique way of "moving"
